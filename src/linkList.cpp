//array and linked list data structure
//Arrays,  1) well suited for situatins where the number of data items is known.
//         2) another strength of arrays is that they can be accessed randomly, by index

//linked list:  1) can hold an arbitrary number of data items, and can easily change size to add or remove items,
//               a linked list is great for storing data when the number of items is either unknown, or subject to change
//              2) so, we have to start at the beginning and traversing through every node until we reach the one we want
