DESCRIPTION:

code about Algorithms
code about Data Structure

FEATURES:
--------------
1)ResizingArrayStack.java defines a stack implementation with a resizing array
2)queue.java defines a queue class (FIFO)
3)link.java defines a link class
4)linkList.java defines a linked list class, where we use relationships between the items to locate it in list
5)firstLastList.java defines a double-ended list function, where we can insert a new item directly at the end of the list as well as the biginning
6)linkStack.java defines a stack class, implemented by a linked list
HOW TO COMPILE:
  >javac link.java linkList.java linkStack.java linkStackApp.java
  >java linkStackApp
7)ArraySort.java defines Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort and shellSort functions 
8)Merge.java defines Top-down mergesort function


Programming Questions on The Course "Algorithms:Design and Analysis" on Stanford
1)Count.cpp computes the number of inversions in the file given (based on MergeSort)
2)ComputeTotalNum.cpp computes the total number of comparisons in the file given (based on QuickSort)
