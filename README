DESCRIPTION:

code about Algorithms
code about Data Structure
TODO: a toolbox for data structure and algorithms

FEATURES:
--------------
src/datastructure:
1)ResizingArrayStack.java defines a stack implementation with a resizing array
2)queue.java defines a queue class (FIFO)
3)link.java defines a link class
4)linkList.java defines a linked list class, where we use relationships between the items to locate it in list
5)firstLastList.java defines a double-ended list function, where we can insert a new item directly at the end of the list as well as the biginning
6)linkStack.java defines a stack class, implemented by a linked list
HOW TO COMPILE:
  >javac link.java linkList.java linkStack.java test/linkStackApp.java
  >java linkStackApp

src:
7)ArraySort.java defines Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort and shellSort functions 
8)Merge.java defines Top-down mergesort function


HOMEWORK:
--------------
Questions on The Course "Algorithms:Design and Analysis" on Stanford
1)homework/Count.cpp computes the number of inversions in the file given (based on MergeSort)
2)homework/ComputeTotalNum.cpp computes the total number of comparisons in the file given (based on QuickSort)

CHALLENGE: some programming problem challenges
