#### about
* Programs = Data structures + Algorithms
* Avi Wigderson gives that “Algorithms has becoming a common language for understanding, nature, human, and computer”. Algorithms as **computational models** are replacing math models in scientific inquiry . People are developing computational models to stimulate what might be happening in nature in order to try to better understand it. Algorithms play an extremely important role in this process .


#### DESCRIPTION: A Toolbox for Algorithms and Data Structure

* Fundamentals
* Sorting
* Searching
