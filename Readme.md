DESCRIPTION: A Toolbox for Algorithms and Data Structure

* Fundamentals
* Sorting
* Searching

* Homework: 
  - Questions in The Stanford "Algorithms:Design and Analysis" Course
    + Count.cpp computes the number of inversions in the file given (based on MergeSort idea)
    + ComputeTotalNum.cpp computes the total number of comparisons in the file given (based on QuickSort idea)

  - ALGORITHMS_PRINCETON:
    + Related exercises and Assignments in the Princeton Algorithms Course


* CHALLENGE: some challenging programming problems
  - Fibonacci.cpp computes the nth Fibonacci number based on different algorithms
