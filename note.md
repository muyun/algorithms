#### Why algorithms
 - Algorithms is method for **solving a problem**
 - Data Structure is method to **store information**
 -
 - to solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed
 - for intellectual stimulation
 - to become a proficient programmer -> data structures and their relationships
 - computational model are replacing math models in scientific inquiry

#### data types

#### Sorting 

#### Searching

#### Graphs
