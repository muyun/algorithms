#### Why algorithms
   *  Algorithms is method for **solving a problem**
   *  Data Structure is method to **store information**
   *  
   *  to solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed
   *  for intellectual stimulation
   *  to become a proficient programmer -> data structures and their relationships
   *  computational model are replacing math models in scientific inquiry  
      - simulate what might be happening in nature in order to try to better understand it  

#### data types  
   * stack  
   * queue  
   * bag  
   * union-find  
   * priority queue  


#### Sorting  
   * quicksort  
   * mergesort  
   * heapsort  
   * radix sorts  

#### Searching  
   * BST  
   * red-black BST  
   * hash table  

#### Graphs  
   * BFS  
   * DFS 

   * Prim  
   * Kruskal
   * Dijkstra  

#### Strings  
   * KMP  
   * regular expressions  
   * TST  
   * Huffman  
   * LZW  

#### advanced  
   * B-tree
   * suffix array  
   * maxflow
